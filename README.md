---> Firt  we create a pipeline for the automate of the running and installation of docker inside our EC2 instance ,and for the building image and running to the container.
---> For this we need to create a docker hub image ,and then we generate a new access token from the github .
--> then we create a github repository with the ci/cd pipeline  then along with this we upload our files app.js  and package.json.
--> along with this we create a new ec2 instance called yashwanth-github-actions.
--> then we ssh into the instance "yashwanth-github-actions "and we install docker in it and give privilege to the current user to run docker commands logout and login to apply this chanages made.
